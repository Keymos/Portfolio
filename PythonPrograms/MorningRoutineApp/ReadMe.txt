The aim of this app is to open a window automating as much of my daily habits as I see fit which include journaling and gym progress tracking. I want it to have a couple of mativation images on the side that will change at fixed intervals as well as another switching widget displaying the goals for the week, month and 6 months seperately.
	_ Always has some motivational images on one side.
	_ On the other side current goals, logs active until the day ends in the middle.
	_ Possibility to read previous logs.
	_ Muscle training needs with interactive image.


Just started working on it.
