The aim of this app is to open a window automating as much of my daily habits as I see fit which include journaling and gym progress tracking. I want it to have a couple of mativation images on the side that will change at fixed intervals as well as another switching widget displaying the goals for the week, month and 6 months seperately.
	_ Always has some motivational images on one side.
	_ On the other side current goals, logs active until the day ends in the middle.
	_ Possibility to read previous logs.
	_ Muscle training needs with interactive image.


Just started working on it.

Update 23/04/2019:
	What I did:
	- Managed to get the general layout of everything right.
	- Imported random image generation from previous project.
	What I work on implementing:
	- Images will change periodically.
	- The two text-fields will display and change according to the buttons.
	- Writing in those fields will update the respective files when closing the app.

Update 24/04/2019
	What I did:
	- The textfileds are almost done with the middle one of them working as I intended it to work while the left one is just a matter of some simple twaeking.
