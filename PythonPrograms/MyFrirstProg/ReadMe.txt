So, this is the first program that I wrote.
It took me about 4-5 hours to finish it.


This program selects 4 random images from 4 folders whose paths are specified in the Paths.txt file and displays them in one window. Clicking on the 'Refresh' button runs the program again and thus showing a new random combination of images.

If using windows, you running the 'Run.bat' file exectues the program by itself.
