So, this is the first program that I wrote.
It took me about 4-5 hours to finish it.


This program selects 4 random images from 4 folders whose paths are specified in the Paths.txt file and displays them in one window. Clicking on the 'Refresh' button runs the program again and thus showing a new random combination of images.

If using windows, you running the 'Run.bat' file exectues the program by itself.


This project is far from perfect. The aim was to just make something that runs while achieving some utility, to start actually practicing.

What I learned:
	- Some basics on how to use Github.
	- A bit more about Tkinter Python Library.
